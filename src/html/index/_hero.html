            <h3>Welcome!</h3>
            <div class="hero__text">
                <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Hi! My name is Albert. I’ve been working on the factory for the last two years. I was leading a team of specialists on the very beginning. And I failed within the first two month. This is not where my employment started, but this is where my story begins.</p>

                <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> I’ve researched for deviation between expectations, success and satisfaction from the project results. And came to the end that all successor points are building blocks for one perfectly designed solution that is a core of all efforts.</p>

                <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> I’ve been a manager that organized all support and needed things for success, and I’ve grown great respect for those professionals that I’ve been working with. With every success I’ve learned something. I’ve copied their behaviour to do something good by myself. That’s how I came to computer science.</p>

                <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> I’ve done things in this field within my life, so I was familiar with a lot of things for hobbyists. But not for the professional, even at the entry level. So I chose Front-End, bearing in mind that it’s the best entry point into industry for ‘aliens’. I’ve entered Beetroot Academy.</p>

                <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Within the graduate process I’ve learned CSS3, SASS, HTML5, JS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Gulp...and all other stuff you can find in my resume. I’ve done some <a href="#skills" style="color: unset; text-decoration: underline;">huge things</a> that I really like, a lot of <a target="_blank" href="https://albert-y-luppol.github.io/beetroot/index/index.html" style="color: unset; text-decoration: underline;">learning tasks</a>, and learned so many <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Albert-Y-Luppol/js/tree/master/js_info" style="color: unset; text-decoration: underline;">useful things</a>. But still, I’m just the one junior front-end developer that needs a set of professionals at least to be productive in my job.</p>

                <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> I’m looking for a warm team that needs a hand in awesome stuff creation. People that love what they do, who do their best on every project and all the time strive to do something better each in their individual field. Because it’s the people that we work with that make us who we are. 
                </p>

                <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> I hope my work raised something good in you as it does in me. Because at the end of the day that’s all it is.
                </p>
